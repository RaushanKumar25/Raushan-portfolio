      <h2>Web Developer</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Raushan Bhardwaj, a passionate and curious learner with a strong foundation in computer science and software development. I enjoy turning ideas into real, working projects using tools and technologies that excite me.

I'm comfortable working with Python and have developed a range of small-scale programs and logical solutions that reflect clean code and clear thinking. I'm also exploring the power of cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I have worked on services like EC2, S3, and IAM to understand cloud fundamentals.

With an eye for detail and a drive to keep learning, I aim to grow into a developer who builds impactful solutions — whether it's through backend logic, cloud deployment, or simply writing elegant, readable code. I believe in simplicity, consistency, and the satisfaction that comes from solving real-world problems through technology.</p>
